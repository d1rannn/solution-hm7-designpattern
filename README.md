# README: Why Use an Iterator Instead of Exposing List<Episode>?

In this project, we use an **Iterator Pattern** instead of simply exposing `List<Episode>` to the outside world.  
Hereâ€™s why:

## 1. Encapsulation
- **Iterator hides internal storage details**.
- A `Season` might store episodes in an `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, or even load them lazily from a file.
- By using an iterator, the client code **doesn't care how episodes are stored** â€” only how to access them (`hasNext()`, `next()`).

## 2. Flexibility
- Different traversal orders (normal, reverse, shuffle) are supported easily by **changing the iterator**, **not the collection**.
- If we exposed the raw `List<Episode>`, we would be stuck with just the natural order or manually sorting it every time.

## 3. Control
- Iterators **control how and when episodes are provided**.
- For example, a **ShuffleIterator** randomizes order once, a **ReverseIterator** gives them backwards, and a **SkipIntroIterator** modifies playback behavior â€” all without changing the underlying data.

## 4. Future-Proofing
- If in the future episodes are loaded **lazily**, or **streamed from a server**, direct access to a `List` would not work anymore.
- Iterators allow smooth transition to lazy-loading or streaming without changing client code.

## 5. Cleaner API
- Instead of exposing a whole list with tons of possible operations (`add`, `remove`, etc.), the iterator **offers a minimal, clean API**: just `hasNext()` and `next()`.

# ðŸ“‹ Conclusion
Using an iterator provides **encapsulation, flexibility, control, and future-proofing**, making the system more robust and maintainable.
